# WTF??

This is utility for auto-reconnecting wifi when it goes down written in python. It will reconnect wifi when internet is unreachable. Pretty useful when you have awful wifi router like mine.

# Setup

Download the repo, open `reconnect.py` file in editor and change `WIFI_SSID` variable to your wifi's ssid.
Run it in shell with `python reconnect.py`.
